Welcome to the ODTKCodeExamples repository, where we share code examples from our favorite utilities and demos from Orbit Determination Tool Kit (ODTK), a commercial software application from ANSYS, Inc.

The repository offers fully functional tools and libraries of example code that you can refactor to fit your needs. These code samples require a legally licensed local copy of the ODTK application; you must obtain ODTK from [AGI's website](https://support.agi.com/downloads/6/ "AGI's Downloads")
