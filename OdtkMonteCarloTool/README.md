# ODTK Monte Carlo Project

This library will allow you to run Monte Carlo analysis on various components of a satellite's force model or the measurement architecture. Main script to run is run_app.py then opening a browser and going to https://localhost:8050/ (port could be different and will be spit out into your command window when you run the script). All required libraries to run the tool are in requirements.txt.

More detailed instructions and video walkthrough coming soon.

Work in progress. Feel free to open an issue or pull request with any feedback.
