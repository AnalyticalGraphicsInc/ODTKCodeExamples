# ODTK Monte Carlo Project

This library will allow you to run Monte Carlo analysis on various components of a satellite's force model or the measurement architecture. Main script to run is run_app.py then opening a browser and going to https://localhost:8050/ (port could be different and will be spit out into your command window when you run the script). All required libraries to run the tool are in requirements.txt.

Very much a work in progress. Contact Cal Van Doren (cal.vandoren@ansys.com) with any questions.
