# Observation and Estimation interactive course

Hello and welcome to this training course, which has been designed to introduce you in the mysterious world of the estimation theory. It has to be considered as a prerequirement for anyone who would like to understand what happens behind the scenes when using ODTK, which makes use of different estimation process to perform orbit determination.
The course spans across three main concepts: statistic, least squares and Kalman filter as they are tightly interconnected when performing estimation of dynamic systems. It is based on several Jupyter Notebooks, each one being focused on a specific topic.

Most of the exercises are interactive, to let you understand how things work and the effects of any input parameter change on the final results.

Have fun!
